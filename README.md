# eXplainable-AI

This repository contains all the code built for my thesis on Explainable AI. 

The dataset used is porperty of the Mobilitycs project and is expected to release publicly soon after the publication of the tesis.

The scripts section contains three folders:

* **dataset_process**, dedicated to preproecssing the dataset in data/raw into the feature slinding windows. The notebooks in this folder must be exectued in order.
* **ML_models**, which contains all the tested models and their performance metrics, alongside experiments usinging diferent interations of our dataset.
* **XAI**, where explainability methods applied to our best performing model.

The source folder contains helper classes developed by Gerard Caravca
